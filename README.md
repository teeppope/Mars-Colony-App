# Project 5: Mars Colony Angular2 App

Project 5 at RED was a big learning curve. This was the first Javascript framework we were taught, so trying to get use to the sytax, and two-way data binding was/is an interesting concept to try and gain an understanding of.

##Meaningful Takeaways
Angular2 seems to be a very useful/powerful framework to build web applications with. While challenging at first to see how pieces fit together and how to represent that with code, I feel like towards the end of the project I started to gain a very basic level of useable understanding of the framework. I look forward to continuing to utilize Angular2's power moving forward.
